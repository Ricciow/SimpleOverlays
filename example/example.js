 * This will create an element to be rendered on screen
 * The element consists of a key, type, x, y, width, height, scale, scaling mode, and the data
 * 
 * There are 4 types of scaling accepted, X, Y, BOTH and NONE:
 * X will only scale the Width when scrolled
 * Y will only scale the Height when scrolled
 * BOTH will scale Width and Height when scrolled
 * NONE will not scale with width and height
 * 
 * The data parameter will vary from element to element, this library currently supports 3 elements,
 * which have their accepted data kinds as the following:
 * CTText - Accepts a string as their data corresponding to the text
 * CTImage - Accepts an Objectified NBT or a CT Item
 * Image - Accepts a string, which is the path to the image
 * 
 * Elements created through code will only be created if the key does not exist.
